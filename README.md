Check it out -  https://resume-builder-lwc.herokuapp.com/

## App Highlights

Presenting a static responsive website enabling users to create their Resume, for any profession. 
Users can also use this to create their Online portfolio and host it for free as per their choice.

It is built using [LWC Open Source](https://lwc.dev/) and [Salesforce Lightning Design System](https://www.lightningdesignsystem.com) and it is hosted for free on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

The resume format and design approach is greatly inspired from the [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org) project - All resume content to display is inspired from this JSON schema.
*For Developers, by Developers.*


## Other Features

1. The Resume Preview is available in Light and Dark Mode and can be toggled from the Top Panel.
2. Users can choose to toggle the visibility of the display picture from the Top Panel
3. The site is responsive and works well on Mobile, Tablets and browsers.
4. Since users need to edit the JSON content and this can be prone to errors and typos, we suggest using JSON Validators (like - https://jsonlint.com/) to ensure the JSON schema integrity is maintained upon parsing it from a string value.
